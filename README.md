# The Censor Ship

This is a small training application that can help you get to know the JavaScript ecosystem a bit better. The goal is to write a small function in JavaScript that can be integrated with the rest of a simple web application. So let's make sure the app runs on your computer and then take a look at how to write the missing function.

## Setup

I will go through these steps rather quickly because they are documented in more detail for the [onboarding project](https://github.com/mdumke/onboarding). Start by cloning the repository. In the terminal, go to a folder of your choice and type

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdumke/censor-ship
```
